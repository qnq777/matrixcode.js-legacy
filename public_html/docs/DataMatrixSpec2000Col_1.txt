Hi all,

Data Matrix 144x144 symbols appear to have an interesting property that
is distinct from other sizes of the said symbology. Specifically, in
144x144 symbols the error correction block alignment for reinterlacing
needs to be "rotated right" by two positions so that the ECC blocks
corresponding to the two "short" data blocks are placed first - which
happens to be entirely contrary to annexe G.2 of ISO/IEC 16022:2000!
However convention appears to out way formality in the matter since the
ECC-block-reordered symbols do scan correctly whilst the plain symbols
do not.

After many hours of pinpointing the cause of the previous 144x144 scan
failures, I've made a new release with the above modification which has
been tested as follows:
